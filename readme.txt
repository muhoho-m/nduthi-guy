 this directory will cotain research and system development for the nganya system.
 
 this will be an entertainment system for matatus with the usual music player, video and audio. it will also incoporate a sound harmonization and fine tuning mechanism.
 sound armony
 video output
 audio play
 audio files mix (video / audio)
  ->this will have a feature to mix video and audio files while paying to provide a sence of continuity of the video/audio file
  ->sort of a dj for random songs. mini-dj
  
in this system i will incoporate another system: a mojor system to support or suppliment the entertainment system

this system will be an advitising system

advertisement strtegy
my idea is to build a system will an advertisement system whereby ad visibility to the screen is triggered bby proximity of the product being advertised: in simple terms, locolized advertising.

lets say for a nganya travellng from Nairobi to Juja. Lets pick for example theres only three major malls on the way, Mountain Mall, Thika Road Mall and Juja City Mall. these malls are located two kilometers from each other respectively.

in this scenario, assuming that all these malls have registered ads with the system, ads from Mountain mall would show when the nganya is 1 kilometer away from the mall and 1 kilometer after passing the mall. then it would proceed to display those from the next mall in close proximity and so forth.
this is meant to locolize ads and verify whether the mode would beat mainstream media.

this system is also to include a video monitoring system, nganya CCTV, both inside and outside the cars.

uses:
record wherebouts
track

inside:
for video inside the cars, poster recogniton will be used to determine whether a passanger is seated according to regulation or not. a report will be issued for passangers standing on the busses.

this will also be trained to recognize sitting positions and count the number of passangers per car.

benefits:
traffic control in cars.
poster recognition algorithms data
face detection and recognition enhancement.

outside:
footage recorded by outside cameras will be used to train machine learning algorithms for future autonomous car research.
